# FIB-IA-PowerStations

This repository contains the first practice of Artificial Intelligence subject where we worked with concepts like Search Space, Heuristic Function, and algorithms of Local Search.

The problem consists in the assignation of a few power stations to clients, always respecting the restrictions imposed and trying to maximize economic gains.

The algorithms used are Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing (from AIMA library), both focused on the mathematical optimization of a given heuristic function that works with search space.

However, in this practice we did not put the focus on the algorithms but on the state representation, the heuristic function and the generation of the successor states.
